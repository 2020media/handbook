# wp checksum core

Verify WordPress files against WordPress.org's checksums.

Downloads md5 checksums for the current version from WordPress.org, and
compares those checksums against the currently installed files.

For security, avoids loading WordPress when verifying checksums.

### OPTIONS

[\--version=&lt;version&gt;]
: Verify checksums against a specific version of WordPress.

[\--locale=&lt;locale&gt;]
: Verify checksums against a specific locale of WordPress.

### EXAMPLES

    # Verify checksums
    $ wp core verify-checksums
    Success: WordPress install verifies against checksums.

    # Verify checksums for given WordPress version
    $ wp core verify-checksums --version=4.0
    Success: WordPress install verifies against checksums.

### GLOBAL PARAMETERS

WP-CLI has a [series of global parameters](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) that work with all commands. They are called _global parameters_ because they affect how WP-CLI interacts with WordPress and have the same behavior across all commands.

Common global parameters include:

| **Argument**    | **Description**              |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------|
| `--path=<path>` | Path to the WordPress files. |
| `--url=<url>`   | Pretend request came from given URL. In multisite, this argument is how the target site is specified. |
| `--user=<user>` | Set the WordPress user.      |
| `--require=<path>` | Load PHP file before running the command (may be used more than once). |
| `--skip-plugins[=<plugin>]` | Skip loading all or some plugins. Note: mu-plugins are still loaded. |
| `--skip-themes[=<theme>]` | Skip loading all or some themes. |

See [global parameter documentation](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/config/) for the full list and other configuration options.
