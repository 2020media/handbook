An ongoing list of ideas and potential improvements for wp-cli.org.

### Website

* Redesign!
* Produce command pages for the packages listed in the package index.
* Publish a set of suggested best practices for package maintainers to follow.

### Package Index

* Display download / installation counts for each package.
* Display number of Github stars for each package.
* Highlight packages in the index that are regularly updated, have multiple maintainers, or reflect some other quality we hold to be important.
* Run test suite for each package on a weekly basis ([from #3197](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/3197#issuecomment-238946219)).
