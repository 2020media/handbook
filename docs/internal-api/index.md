description: Stable utilities considered safe to use in community commands.

WP-CLI includes a number of utilities which are considered stable and meant to be used by commands.

This also means functions and methods not listed here are considered part of the private API. They may change or disappear at any time.

*Internal API documentation is generated from the WP-CLI codebase on every release. To suggest improvements, please submit a pull request.*
